Project Name: HTML/CSS Wireframe Exercise

I built an HTML/CSS wireframe with the project specs provided.  This is to help the client understand the layout so that they can make suggestions/recommendations prior to further work being completed.  Placeholder pictures are used to provide an agnostic approach and to not influence the client on any stylistic approaches so they may be able to fully implement their vision.

submission PR: The original project in the 201 daytime class was done off of the main branch so no PR required. 

Reflections and Comments:  I had completed this in the 201 daytime class, but have deleted the work so that I could do it again for practice.  This exercise has helped me to fundamentally understand how to quickly and efficiently layout HTML.  Prior to this exercise I had relied mostly on id's in order to style elements.  However, this has changed my perspective as to using tags so that they can be reused when we get into Jquery.  This exercise reinforced the different methods to use elements in CSS.
